        <h2 class="center">ABOUT ME</h2>
        <p class="center"><em>My Creative Journey</em></p>
        <p>My name is Rhea Moozhayil, and I currently go to the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. I study Computer Science + Advertising
            which I believe is a really unique major. </p>
            <p> I have learned so much in all of my courses including various coding languages like Python, C++,
            Java, Javascript, Typescript, and node.js. I've worked with different frameworks like React Native, Angular, and Android Studio. I also have experience in SQL 
            and have worked with databases in my courses.</p>
            <p> But I believe that I am a true creative at heart. I took an Advertising class, called Creative Concepts, and got to make actual campaigns which then got entered into a contest!
                I ended up winning Best Ad for one of my ads that was in the contest, which was judged by a senior director at Highdive Advertising.
            </p>
            <p>With this website that I coded, I hope that you get an insight of all my work over these past few years that I have put out. I am very passionate
                about my future, and would love the opportunity to see where I can go with this! Enjoy : &#41;
